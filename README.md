# Changelog Component

This repository contains a small, responsive changelog component implemented with semantic HTML and CSS. It's intended as a teaching example for positioning and layout in CSS (timeline layout, alternating items, responsive stacking).

Files
- `index.html` — contains the changelog component and example entries.
- `styles.css` — styling and responsive layout for the component.

How to run / preview

1. Open `index.html` directly in your browser. Double-click the file or open it via `File → Open` in your browser.

2. (Optional) Serve with a simple HTTP server for a local preview (recommended when loading via modules or for better development behavior):

```bash
# from the project folder
python3 -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
```

Notes
- Resize the browser window to see the layout switch between a two-column timeline and a single stacked list on small screens.
- The component is intentionally small and framework-agnostic so it can be embedded into other sites.
